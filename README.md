DayZ Chernarus - Krona Castle Outer Wall Restoration.
I had this idea for a restoration projekt at Krona.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 20x Land_Castle_Wall1_20.
2: 1x Bonfire.


So, easiest way to find this is if you go to Vybor and then keep going towards Lopatino. Drive past the gasstation. 
Keep an eye out for a pub with red bricks for walls.
Once you get to the pub there should be a left turn. Take that left turn and keep follow the road till you get to a chapel.
There is also a wrecked Sarka a few meters before the pub. And once you take that left turn, there should be a red house on the left side on that road.
So when you get to the chapel there should be some power lines on the right side of the road. Follow them till you get to another red house.
You should be able to see a wooden barn, follow the powerlines towards the barn and keep following them on the road.
There should be a wrecked Olga and a ADA on the left side, the ADA is next to a shed with a small wooden cabin and a few meters ahead there will
be a right turn where the powerlines go. And then you will be outside the castle.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/KronaCastleOuterWallRestoration.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/KronaCastleOuterWallRestoration.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
